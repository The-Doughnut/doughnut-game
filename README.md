# doughnut-game

This is a text based game, written in a batch script which runs on Windows 2000 and up.

<h3>What is the game?</h3>

This is a "choose your own story" type of game. You are the protagonist and you will choose what will happen next.

<b>Story</b><br>
It all started on an ordinary day where you were ready to go to school. Or was it an ordinary day? Find out what mysterious event is happening in your area whilst avoiding many daily and trivial dangers.

<h3>Development</h3>

This game is far from finished. Any feedback in terms of gameplay and typos are appreciated!

<h3>How to play</h3>

In order to run the game, you can simply download the .bat of the version of your choice and run it directly if you are on a Windows 2000 machine or newer. Unfortunately, the game is not really compatible with MacOS or Linux unless if you manage to find a way to run batch files yourself.

Be careful though, there may be unknown bugs!
